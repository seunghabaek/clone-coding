# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run build` fails to minify

### export/ export default의 차이

export: 하나 이상의 모듈이 있을 수 있음을 암시
export default: 하나의 모듈만 있음.
따라서 export만으로 모듈을 내보내게 되면, import하는 쪽에서는 {}를 같이 써서 불러와야하고,
export default로 모듈을 내보내면, import하는 쪽에서는 {} 없이 불러올 수 있다.

### 호환성 문제

JS와 패키지 간 호환성 문제가 있을 수 있으니, 뭔가 이상하다 싶으면 docs 볼것.
react-router-dom <Switch> -> <Routes> & <Route></Route> -> <Route element />

### javascript 조건문

A && B : A가 true이면 B를 반환하고, A가 false이면 A를 반환한다.
A || B : A가 true이면 A를 반환하고, A가 false이면 B를 반환한다.
